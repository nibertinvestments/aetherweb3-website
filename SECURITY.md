## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

#### API Key Security
```bash
# ✅ DO: Use environment variables
export API_KEY="your-api-key"

# ❌ DON'T: Hardcode in source code
const apiKey = "sk_live_abcd1234";
```

#### Request Security
```javascript
// ✅ DO: Validate all inputs
function validateRequest(req) {
  const { method, params } = req.body;
  if (!ALLOWED_METHODS.includes(method)) {
    throw new Error('Method not allowed');
  }
  // Additional validation...
}

// ❌ DON'T: Trust user input
function unsafeRequest(req) {
  const result = eval(req.body.code); // NEVER DO THIS
  return result;
}
```

#### Error Handling
```javascript
// ✅ DO: Generic error messages
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  logger.error(err);
  res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal server error' });
});

// ❌ DON'T: Expose internal details
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  res.status(500).json({ 
    error: err.message,
    stack: err.stack // Exposes internal information
  });
});
```

### For Users

#### API Key Management
- **Rotate Regularly**: Change API keys periodically
- **Environment Variables**: Store keys in environment variables
- **Monitoring**: Monitor API key usage for anomalies
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Use keys with minimal required permissions

#### Network Security
- **HTTPS Only**: Always use HTTPS endpoints
- **IP Whitelisting**: Restrict API access to known IP ranges when possible
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement client-side rate limiting
- **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in error messages

## Security Monitoring

### Real-time Monitoring

We continuously monitor for:

- **Failed Authentication Attempts**: Unusual login patterns
