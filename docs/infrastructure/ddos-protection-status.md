## DNS Configuration

| Record | Domain | Target | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| CNAME | aetherweb3.xyz | nibertinvestments.github.io | 🟠 PROXIED |
| CNAME | www.aetherweb3.xyz | aetherweb3.xyz | 🟠 PROXIED |  
| CNAME | api.aetherweb3.xyz | Cloud Run backend | 🟠 PROXIED |

## Why You Keep Full Protection

### ✅ **Proxied Records (Orange Cloud)**
- Traffic routes: Internet → Cloudflare → GitHub Pages
- Full DDoS protection active
- SSL certificates managed by Cloudflare
- Caching and optimization enabled

### ❌ **DNS-Only Records (Gray Cloud)** 
- Traffic routes: Internet → GitHub Pages (direct)
- No Cloudflare protection
- Vulnerable to attacks
- **You DON'T have this - you're protected!**
