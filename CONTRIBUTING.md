### Suggesting Features

We welcome feature suggestions! Please:

1. **Check existing feature requests** first
2. **Explain the use case** and why it would be valuable
3. **Provide detailed specifications** when possible
4. **Consider backward compatibility** implications

### Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/aetherweb3-website.git
   cd aetherweb3-website
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up environment**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

5. **Create a branch** for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Making Changes

#### Code Style

- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Ensure proper error handling
- Maintain consistent indentation (2 spaces)

#### Testing

- Add tests for new functionality
- Ensure all existing tests pass
- Aim for good test coverage
- Test edge cases and error conditions

```bash
# Run tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npm test -- tests/api.test.js

# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage
```

#### Linting

We use ESLint to maintain code quality:

```bash
# Check linting
npm run lint

# Auto-fix linting issues
npm run lint -- --fix
```

### Commit Guidelines

We follow conventional commit format:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)

### Key Principles

- **Security First**: All changes must maintain security standards
- **Performance**: Consider performance implications
- **Scalability**: Design for scale from the start
- **Maintainability**: Write clean, readable code
- **Documentation**: Keep docs up to date

### API Design

- Follow RESTful principles

- Provide clear error messages
- Implement proper validation
- Support JSON-RPC 2.0 format

## Security Considerations

### Security Reviews

All security-related changes require additional review:

- Input validation modifications
- Cryptographic implementations
- External API integrations

### Reporting Security Issues

**DO NOT** create public issues for security vulnerabilities. Instead:

1. Email security@nibertinvestments.com
2. Include detailed description and steps to reproduce
3. Allow time for proper fix and disclosure
